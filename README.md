# Dance Moves
## A Starter Project for QuickFix #1

1. Use the GitHub web site to create a "fork" of this project
    * _Wait, but why can't I use the GUI?_
        * You can if you're a [member of the organization][h-perms] that hosts the repository, or if the person who owns the repository [adds you as a collaborator][h-collab].

    * _Wait, but what good is cloning if I can never make changes?_
        * Maybe you just want to _use_ the software. Plenty of software projects (particularly stuff like [text editor plugins](https://github.com/vim-scripts "Plugins for the Vim editor") and [web development frameworks](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap#quick-start "Twitter Bootstrap")) use Git as a means of distributing their software. You just `git clone` the project into a particular directory and BAM! If you wanted to _contribute_ to these projects, you'd [make a fork][g-fork]).

2. _Now_ use the GitHub GUI to "clone" this repository to your laptop
